# Hit Play

Hit Play is a WPF application that utilizes the phish.in API to access musical shows spanning from the earliest days to the present.

This application is currently a work in progress, with the following features implemented:

1. **Playing Random Show**: Allows users to play a randomly selected show from thousands of available shows using the API.

2. **Top 20 Songs of the Week**: Enables users to play the top 20 recent shows based on the API data.

Special thanks to phish.in for providing the API key necessary to access their data.

## Tools Used

- **API Testing**: Postman was used for testing API queries, making it easier to interact with the phish.in API.
